You know what it is.

## How this will work (from a runner's & user's perspective)

A user places a call or text to the publicly published main number, then the
code checks to see who is on call. Whoever is on call and hasn't had a new
user call in for the longest gets the call or text. If no one is on call, the
call or text goes to the default runner, they're like backup.

There is a number runners can text to put themselves on a break. The runner can
text the word "break" and the time their break will be over (in 24hr military
time) to take themselves off call temporarily (like if you got work or
something). When their break is over, they'll get a text reminding them that
they're back on call.

Once a week the schedule will be set. Runners will pick which days they'll be
on call. If a runner needs to give up a shift they need to convince another
runner who isn't already on call to text in "takeover" and the number of the
runner they're covering for.
